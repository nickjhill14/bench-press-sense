# Bench Press Sense
A ubiquitous, “seamful” computing system that manipulates, analyses, and processes sensor data streams gathered from a weightlifter bench-pressing a barbell. 

The aim of the system is to provide an analytical tool to users enabling them to improve their current bench-press form. Due to the risk associated with lifting heavy weights, the system warns the user when their form poses a potential risk.
